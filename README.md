# React Patterns Monorepo

Ready-to-use React patterns with live testing and hot-reload development workflow.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

Start the development server with live updates (packages automatically reflect in the example app):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs both the web app and patterns library in watch mode.

## Testing

Use TDD workflow - start with tests, add implementation, stop when tests pass:

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

## Documentation

For detailed patterns and examples, see [react-patterns-docs package](./packages/react-patterns-docs/README.md).
